This Python script generates directed graphs from LaTeX documents which show dependencies between theorems.

Originally, it was written for use in my diploma thesis (which is finished now), but I may continue
development if there is interest.

The documentation is from the appendix of my thesis and is currently only available in German. But looking
at the source code, you should be able to quickly see what happens.

HOW TO USE:

Make sure GraphViz is installed, then execute:
  generate-graphs.py your-file.tex
Configuration is done at the beginnig of the script file.

Also, you will have to do some changes to your LaTeX document, to produce good and readable results. Define
the following commands and use them in your theorem environments to fine-tune the graph:

  \newcommand{\graphref}[1]{\unskip\vphantom{\ref{#1}}}    - Adds a \ref which only shows up in the graph
  \newcommand{\graphcaption}[1]{\unskip}                   - Sets the caption of the corresponding node
  \newcommand{\invref}[1]{\unskip\vphantom{\ref{#1}}}      - Adds an invisible edge to the graph (can be
                                                             used to influence the layout)

What you should know before usage:

- The script will only work correctly when you have organized your file into chapters and use chapter-level
  numbering of theorems. Otherwise you will have to change the code related to numbering.
- \includes are being followed, but only one level. Deeper includes won't currently work.
- When you run the script for the first time, expect no miracles. It can take a lot of time to make a graph
  look really good.
